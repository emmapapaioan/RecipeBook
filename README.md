# ShoppingProject

ShoppingProject is a web application developed using Angular framework. It allows users to store recipes to a remote database. Also users can view, edit and delete any recipes.


## Technologies
The project is developed using Angular, a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework. It also uses other technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the following command:
```npm install```

You can then start the development server and launch the application in your browser by running the following command:
```ng serve```

The application should be available at http://localhost:4200/.

## Status

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller for creating the "The Complete Guide to Angular 2" Udemy course , which has been a great resource for learning Angular development. This is a project that I am building to practice Angular development. It is still under construction and I am building it as I follow the specific course.
