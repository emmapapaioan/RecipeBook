<h1>ShoppingProject <em><sub><sup>  *Under construction</sup></sub></em></h1>

ShoppingProject is a web application developed using Angular framework. It allows users to store recipes to a remote database. Also users can view, edit and delete any recipes.

## Technologies
The project is developed using Angular, a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework. It also uses other technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and TypeScript.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, you need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your machine. You can then clone the repository using the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/emmapapaioan/ShoppingProject.git```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the following command:
```npm install```. If the result is not successfull, try ```npm install --legacy-peer-deps``` or ```npm install --force```. These commands will attempt to install the dependencies, with the last two options providing alternative ways to handle issues with peer dependencies or other conflicts.

You can then start the development server and launch the application in your browser by running the following command:
```ng serve```

The application should be available at http://localhost:4200/.

## Status
The project is currently under development, and new features and improvements are being added regularly.

## Acknowledgments
This project is being built as I follow along with the Udemy course "The Complete Guide to Angular 2" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. It serves as a practical application to enhance my skills in Angular development. The project is still under construction.
