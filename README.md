RecipeBook is a web application developed using Angular framework. It allows users to store, view, edit, print, or delete recipes from a remote database. The project also provides OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality where users can upload an image with text (a recipe image, for example) and retrieve the text from the image.

## View Production Site

This project is deployed using Firebase Hosting. You can access the live version of the application by clicking the link:
[View Production Site](https://recipe-book-41dd4.web.app/).

## Technologies

The project is developed using Angular, a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework. It also uses other technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and TypeScript.

## Server-Side and OCR Functionality
The project includes server-side functionality essential for the OCR feature, particularly when the uploaded file is from an internet URL and a CORS policy exists. To use the server, navigate to the server-side directory and start it with the following command:
```bash
node app.js
```

## Local Development Setup

To set up your local development environment for this project, you need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your machine. You can then clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emmapapaioan/ShoppingProject.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

You can then start the development server and launch the application in your browser by running the following command:
```bash
ng serve
```

The application should be available at http://localhost:4200/ or at whatever port is available.

## Deployment

To deploy your own version of the application, you'll need to set up your own Firebase project. Follow these steps:

1. **Setup Firebase Project**:
   - Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Obtain your project ID and update the Firebase configuration in your project's environment settings.

2. **Build the Project**:
   - Ensure you have Angular CLI installed. Then, build your project with:
     ```bash
     ng build
     ```

3. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**:
   - Install Firebase CLI by running `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
   - Authenticate the Firebase CLI with your Google account by running `firebase login`.
   - Initialize Firebase in your project directory (if not already done):
     ```bash
     firebase init
     ```
   - Deploy the built project to Firebase Hosting:
     ```bash
     firebase deploy --project your-firebase-project-id
     ```
