RecipeBook is a web application developed using Angular framework. It allows users to store, view, edit, print, or delete recipes from a remote database. The project also provides OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality where users can upload an image with text (a recipe image, for example) and retrieve the text from the image.

## Deployment 

This project is deployed using Firebase Hosting. You can access the live version of the application by clicking the link: 
[View Production Site](https://recipe-book-41dd4.web.app/).

To deploy your own version of the application, follow these steps:
1. Build the project using Angular CLI:
   ```bash
   ng build
3. Deploy the built project to Firebase Hosting:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy

## Technologies

The project is developed using Angular, a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework. It also uses other technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and TypeScript.

## Local Development Setup

To set up your local development environment for this project, you need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your machine. You can then clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/emmapapaioan/ShoppingProject.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

You can then start the development server and launch the application in your browser by running the following command:
```bash
ng serve
```

The application should be available at http://localhost:4200/ or at whatever port is available.

## Server-Side and OCR Functionality
The project includes server-side functionality essential for the OCR feature, particularly when the uploaded file is from an internet URL and a CORS policy exists. To use the server, navigate to the server-side directory and start it with the following command:
```bash
node app.js
```

## Acknowledgments
This project is being built as I follow along with the Udemy course "The Complete Guide to Angular 2" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. It serves as a practical application to enhance my skills in Angular development.
